This Repository is on the BigMart‚Äôs sale prediction proposed by Analytics Vidhya.According to the information provided, Bigmart is a big supermarket chain, with stores all around the country and its current board set out a challenge to all Data Scientist out there to help them create a model that can predict the sales, per product, for each store. BigMart has collected sales data from the year 2013, for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. With this information the corporation hopes we can identify the products and stores which play a key role in their sales and use that information to take the correct measures to ensure success of their business.

## Dataset  üòÉ
- In This work I have used 2013 Sales data of Big Mart as the dataset.
- Where the dataset consists of 12 attributes like Item Fat, Item Type, Item MRP,
Outlet Type, Item Visibility, Item Weight, Outlet Identifier, Outlet Size, Outlet
Establishment Year, Outlet Location Type, Item Identifier and Item Outlet Sales.
- Out of these attributes response variable is the Item Outlet Sales attribute and
remaining attributes are used as the predictor variables.
- The data-set consists of 8523 products across different cities and locations. 
- The data-set is also based on hypotheses of store level and product level. Where store level involves attributes
like: city, population density, store capacity, location, etc and the product level
